\chapter{Physics-based animation and control: State of the art}
\label{chap:star}

\Lettrine{T}{his} chapter presents a state of the art on physics-based animation and control.
As physics-based animation is a huge field of research, we cannot cover it all.
We choose to focus our review on three topics which are directly related to the following chapters.
First, we propose a short introduction to continuum mechanics and to the different physically-based models used through this thesis.
Then, we present an extensive review of the different adaptive physically-based models used in Computer Graphics.
Finally, we present various approaches for the control of physically-based simulations.
