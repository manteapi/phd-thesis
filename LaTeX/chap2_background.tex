\chapter[State of the art]{Physics-based animation and control: State of the art}
\label{chap:star}
\Lettrine{T}{his} chapter presents a state of the art on physics-based animation and control.
As physics-based animation is a huge field of research, we cannot cover it all.
We choose to focus our review on two topics which are directly related to the following chapters.
First, we propose a short introduction to continuum mechanics and to the different physically-based models used through this thesis.
Then, we describe various approaches for the control of physically-based animations.

\input{starControl}
